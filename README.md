Extensions created to extend the ScratchX platform

Extensions hosted here are for the ScratchX platform found at http://scratchx.org/
They were created by David Ferguson for use at a programming club.

Extensions include an easy way to control a Raspberry Pi and a way of sending messages and data between different ScratchX sessions running across the internet.
